# Trade-Algorithm
Swing Trading Algorithm for BTC/USDT is an automated swing trading algorithm designed for the Binance spot market. This project analyzes swing lows and volume imbalances in BTC/USDT price data to place limit buy orders, enhancing trading efficiency. It uses Python, the ccxt library for Binance integration, and python-dotenv for secure API key management. The algorithm detects swing lows based on price and volume data, identifies liquidity imbalances to determine optimal entry points, and places limit buy orders on the Binance spot market. It’s configurable with a default timeframe of 15 minutes and an order offset of 10 USDT.

To use this project, you’ll need Python 3.8 or higher, along with the required libraries: ccxt for Binance API integration and python-dotenv for secure API key handling. You’ll also need Binance API keys with spot trading permissions. To install, clone this repository using git clone https://github.com/your_username/swing-trading-algorithm.git, navigate to the project directory, and install dependencies with pip install ccxt python-dotenv. Then, create a .env file in the project root with your Binance API keys like this: API_KEY=your_binance_api_key and SECRET_KEY=your_binance_secret_key.

To run the algorithm, ensure your .env file is correctly configured, then execute the script with python swing_algorithm.py. The algorithm will fetch real-time BTC/USDT data, analyze swing lows, and attempt to place a limit buy order if conditions are met. You can configure the timeframe (default is 15m or 15 minutes—modify timeframe='15m' in fetch_recent_data to use other intervals like 5m or 1h), the offset (default pip_offset=10 or 10 USDT—adjust in find_swing_low_entry based on market volatility), and the amount (default amount=0.01 BTC or ~$970 at $97,000 BTC price—adjust in find_swing_low_entry based on your balance).

Note that this algorithm targets the spot market. For futures trading, modify the symbol to BTC/USDT:USDT and update exchange options (see code comments). Ensure you have sufficient USDT balance on your Binance spot account to cover orders, and test the algorithm on a demo account or with historical data before live trading.
